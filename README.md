Fire Detection using Random Forest Algorithm
The Fire Detection using Random Forest Algorithm project is an innovative solution that combines IoT, machine learning, and embedded systems to address the critical issue of fire detection. The project features a sensing node equipped with sensors for data collection and a central node utilizing a Raspberry Pi to host the machine learning model.

Description
Fires pose significant risks to both life and property. Traditional fire detection methods may not always be reliable or efficient. This project leverages IoT technology, machine learning algorithms, and embedded systems to enhance fire detection capabilities.

The sensing node is responsible for collecting data using various sensors, which could include temperature sensors, smoke detectors, and humidity sensors. This data is then transmitted to the central node.

The central node, powered by a Raspberry Pi, hosts the machine learning model. The model, based on the Random Forest algorithm, analyzes the sensor data to detect patterns indicative of a fire. Upon detection, the system can trigger alerts or take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk.

Languages Used
C++
Python
Getting Started
